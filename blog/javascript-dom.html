    <h3 class="jsdom-p">Difference between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>
        HTML is a markup language, it can be seen as the building blocks of a website
        <br>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet, it is essentially the design and the appeal of a website (everything that makes it pretty)
        <br>
        In a sense, HTML is the foundation and the structures of a building. Whereas, css is the paint of the walls and the furniture in the building (everything decorative).
    </p>
    <h3 class="jsdom-p">DOM</h3>
    <img class="dom-img" src="../images/pic_htmltree.gif" alt="dom-tree">
    <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs are able to manipulate document structure, styles, and content. 
The DOM is connected like a family tree, representing everything from .document to head, body, title and all '<>' contents on the page.
<br>
When a browser receives an HTML document, all it sees is a long list of characters. 
It then converts this string of characters into something it can use to render the site into div tags, into img tags, into parents and children, so on and so forth.
 The resulting model is called the DOM tree, and is basically a long list of all the tags on the page and their relation to each other.

        The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
    </h3>
    <p>
        Both arrays and objects are considered “special” in JavaScript. They are both mutable. However, Objects represent a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Whereas, Arrays are multiple values in a single variable.
    </p>
<ul>
    <li>Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections, where items can be accessed by their numerical position.
    </li>
    <li>
        Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code, anything that can be defined by a set of characteristics (properties). 

    </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="jsdom-p">
    Functions
</h3>
<p>
    Functions are blocks of code designed to perform any particular task. One of the main benefits of a function is that it is able to compute laborious tasks, like calculating a lot of maths and numbers. A function can also be used to test codes, which becomes important when debugging codes.
</p>
<h3 class="jsdom-p">
    Control Flow
</h3>
<img class="control-chart" src="../images/For-loop-diagram.png" alt="control-flow-chart">
<p>
    Control flow is the order in which the program's code is executed. Code is run in order from the first line to the last, however there are times where the computer runs across the structures (conditionals and loops) that changes the control flow.
<br>
    Loops are used to repeat a block of code until the citeria is met. An example of loop: When you purchase something online with your credit card, the function will loop until it approves the validity of your card.
    <br>

<ul>Analogy: 
    <li>when you have the desire to drink water</li>
    <li>you check if you have a container of sort</li>
    <li>if the container already have exisiting liquids</li>
    <li>if the liquid is the desired (loop, if the liquid isn't, find the appropriate, fill the liquid)</li>
    <li>drink the liquid</li> 
</ul>
