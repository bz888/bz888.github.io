                <p>
                    Welcome to the first page of my blog 
                    <br> 
                    What I have learnt:
                    
                    <h2>How to navigate through git bash during command lines.<br></h2>
                    <p>It is a tool that allows you to directly inform the system how to behave, instead of using the graphic interface.<br>
                    This not only speeds up the navigation process, it also allows more advance functions that are not apparent using the graphic interface.<br>
                    <strong>Common command lines:</strong><br>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>cd (change directory)</strong><br>
                        Commonly used to change locations, and navigate through files.</li>
                        <li><strong>ls (list directory contents)</strong><br>Used to understand what is exisiting inside the directory/folder.</li>
                        <li><strong>mkdir</strong><br>To create a new directory</li>
                        <li><strong>rmdir<br></strong>removing a directory</li>
                        <li><strong>mv</strong><br>moving a file or directory</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Navigating and understand the functions of gitHub<br>
                        <strong>What is a branch and the purposes in creating one.<br></strong>
                        Add more content to the main without impacting it, almost like a safty net in case anything you've worked on decides to poop out.<br>
                        For instance, the exercise 'ko-wai-ko' was used to show the functions of branch, merge, pull and fork.<br>In my case, I accidently overwrote the master file with my branch and deleted a lot of people's previous works. (I am very sorry!)<br>
                        Branch and fork are two different workflows that adapt to various situations, such as<br>
                        <strong>Fork</strong><br>
                        -using someone else's project as a starting point for your own ideas, working from a template.
-allows the main to accept commits form any developer without giving write access to offical codebase
-it allows the developer to have their own private repository
-open source projects.<br>
Where as the purpose of <strong>branch</strong> is to add more content to the main without impacting it, almost like a safty net in case anything you've worked on decides to poop out.<br>

Sprint 1 also gave me the knowledge and opportunity to create this blog, using basic html and css.<br>
this blog has had many editions. For instance, how to add an image or text to the blog using html and css.<br>
Add image - <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">how to add image html</html></a>        
Add text -  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp">how to add text html</a>
