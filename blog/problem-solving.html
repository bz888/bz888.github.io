            <h3>the Problem (rough-time)</h3>
            <p>
                During the exercise “JS-Gradebook” I was stuck on a question for a few hours, countless tabs googling possible solutions. The problem was ‘testScore’ is undefined, basically me telling someone this is an orange, its round, colored orange, looks like an orange, but having them reply “no its not”. 
            </p>
            <ul>Techniques I attempted
                <li>I tried looking at the question if it's asking for the same I am giving.</li>
                <li>I ran tests to see if it would work if I told them it's an apple and they would return the same information.</li>
                <li>Googled countless ways to say orange.</li>
                <li>In the end I asked Joseph, turns out I spelt orange as ‘ornage’</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It was a bug I could’ve fixed so easily but failed to expose. It did help me understand the process of debugging; 
                locate possible cause of issue, go over all the sources the code is connected to, go over them carefully, multiple tests to expose bugs. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>the Problem (smooth-time)</h3>
            <p>
                During the exercise “Built-in methods” I was perplexed why my code for deBuzz wasn’t functioning to the standard. The problem was a function that was filtering out the word ‘buzz’ and returning the sentence without ‘buzz’. However, my code did that but for some reason it didn’t meet the criteria. Analogy; entering the same password I wrote down, but refused my entrance.
            </p>
            <ul>Methods I tried
                <li>I looked into the code, tested it with console.log()</li>
                <li>Then realised the “password” I wrote down did not include the capitalization to the matching password.</li>
                <li>So I fiddled with the order of the code, to give me the password that matched the one given. Boom! It worked.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I felt good, I felt like my hours of codecamp really helped me understand how to read and the logics of coding.
            </p>
            <p>What I learnt:<br>
                I learnt how the order of functions plays in the end result and how important it was to test my code using console.log() to see the current result.
