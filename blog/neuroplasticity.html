            <h3>What is Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
                Neuroplasiticty can be viewed as a general term for the brain’s ability to modify, change and adapt (both structure and function wise in response to the individual’s experiences).  The brain does this by creating/strengthening connections between neurons inside our brain.
            <br>
            </p>
            <ul> There are many benefits to neuroplasticity
                <li>Learning new things</li>
                <li>Enhancing cognitive capabilites</li>
                <li>Recover from strokes or traumatic brain injuries</li>
                <li>Improvments towards overall brain fitness</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
                After watching Carol Dweck’s TED talk on growth mindset, I have to realise that my attitude towards learning/improving will impact and dictate the result of my neural connections. In order to strengthen aspects of my brain I must repeatedly exercise the uncomfortable (to obtain comfort).
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
                Much like other muscle groups, the brain can be strengthened through similar methods, practise. When an activity is repeated and practised, the brain will create/strengthen the neural networks in accordance to the activity, allowing mastery towards the activity.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
            <p>
                Growth mindset describes the underlying beliefs people have about learning and intelligence. When an individual believes they can become smarter/more proficient in their craft by investing more effort. Therefore, the extra time and effort invested results in higher achievements. 
            <br>
            In contrast, “fixed” mindset describes the belief; talents and traits are set from birth and will not/can not be changed regardless of effort.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                During this exploration, I’ve come to realise/understand the importance of mindset, and how it will affect my ability to learn. After watching Carol Dweck’s TED talk, I came to realise how I can integrate this mindset into my own learning routine; tackle challenges, don’t be phased by them, effort, effort ,effort and failure can only mean a step closer to success.
