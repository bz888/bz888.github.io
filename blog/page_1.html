    Hello my friends, I am a turtle. I enjoy doing turtle things when I am alive. I enjoy making turtle sounds when I am alive. I enjoy eating turtle food when I am alive. I enjoy living as a turtle when I am alive. I enjoy being alive, but when I am not alive I am dead. 6-28-2008 Hello, I am a dead human. I enjoy dreaming about what it would have been like to be you. 12-22-2008 Hello, I am a human. I enjoy thinking. I enjoy going about my day without daydreaming. I enjoy not having a life. 8-16-2009 Hello, I am a human again. I enjoy inaction. I enjoy moving slowly. I enjoy the way things are in the beginning. I enjoy when something is new. I enjoy when there are unexpected motions. I enjoy my lack of feelings towards this existence.
