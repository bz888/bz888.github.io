            <h3>
                What is Emotional Intelligence?
            </h3>
            <p>
                The term "emotional intelligence", commonly known at EQ. It was developed in the 1990s in an attempt to scientifically measure people's ablities for emotional judgement. As reseachers realised that IQ does not accurately measure one's intelligence. 
                Psychologist Howard Gardner suggests that there are actually multiple intelligences and that people may have strengths in a number of these areas.

            <h3>
                Importance of EQ
            </h3>
            <p>
                As important as IQ plays in success in life, EQ is equally as important. Many companies are mandating EQ training and incorporating EQ tests within their hiring process. As in a work environment everyone functions as a collaborative group and without basic social skills team cooperation may be hindered.
