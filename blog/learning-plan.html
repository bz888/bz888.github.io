                    Strengths and limitations in relation to learning Strengthens:
                    <p>
                        I am a curious soul, always edging for more knowledge
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tend to struggle when I am lost. Uncertainty definitely fears me. 
                        I tend to expect too much out of myself at times,
                        <br> and become really put off when I donâ€™t reach my desired heights. 
                        <br>At times these ambitions become a demotivator.

                    How will I manage workload?
                    <p>
                       Constantly refer to peers and brief to make sure I am on track.

                    When things are building up and starting to get to me
                    <p>
                        Follow a schedule that allows more breaks in between (fresh eyes really helped).

                    Seek help in a timely manner
                    <p>
                        Ask my cohort for help, keep myself updated within the slack channels

                        To assist me when I am really stuck and set me on track

                    <p>
                        I work on the weekends, however, it is a casual contract and I have the freedom to refuse shifts when things are getting too much.

                    <p>
                        This answer will be similar to when I started foundation course. After touching bases with Javascript, I've realised how fun and deep it is. At this time I only hope to learn more and pursuit down this pathway/industry.
