                    <p>
                        I am a curious soul, always edging for more knowledge
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tend to struggle when I am lost. Uncertainty definitely fears me. 
                        I tend to expect too much out of myself at times,
                        <br> and become really put off when I donâ€™t reach my desired heights. 
                        <br>At times these ambitions become a demotivator.
                    </p>

                        Become more open and communicative, learning how to function within collaborative projects.
