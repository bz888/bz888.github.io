            <h3>Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego as a result of the Core learning?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning new things is hard, I feel stupid and clueless, and that is normal, however in order for that to change is effort.</li>
                <li>When learning more difficult concepts, my brain disconnects fast.</li>
                <li>I am able to understand things, when I continuously tackle it.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To understand who I am as a person and how I can improve in accordance with my learning speed.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The importance of mindset</li>
                <li>In the coding industry, skill is not everything, there are other factors like EQ that all correlate to success in this field.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding my learning style and cater towards it</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Why fixate so much on core learning in a web development bootcamp coourse?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Because, success in this industry does not 100% correlate to skill. Core learning is able to help with self development and enhancing the self. So when unpredictable problems arrive, the self is well-equipped to combat these problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I've learnt a lot through core learning
                    <ul>
                        <li>Growth mindset</li>
                        <li>The importance of my learning style</li>
                        <li>How to ehance my learning abilities</li>
                        <li>Industry expectation outside programming skills</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
