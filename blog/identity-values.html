                The most recent ethical decision I had to make was understanding how integrity functioned within programming. After consulting Joseph, I realised that integrity is more on a moral level. Understand the things I copy, rather than doing it for the sake of deadlines.

                As a second gen immigrant from China, Iâ€™ve realised the importance and the sacrifices my parents made. In an attempt to treasure their efforts I want to show them I am doing well in life. 
I guess family matters a lot to me.

                Despite my social anxiety for large groups, I do work well in environments where I feel comfortable voicing my opinions (must befriend my colleagues!).
I definitely feel perseverance will help me push through a lot of coding struggles

                For my graduation project, I was working collaboratively with one of my classmates. However, we did run into a lot of struggles in terms of time management and deadlines. In an attempt to address it, we made checklists for every 3 days, it was important that the tasks were achievable. By doing so, our productivity as a duo increased significantly. I have been using this technique to combat my poor time management.
